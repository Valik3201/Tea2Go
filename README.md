# Tea2Go - Portfolio Project

## Overview

Tea2Go is a delightful virtual tea cafe that I've created as part of my web development journey at Codecademy. The goal of this project is to showcase my skills in building a web page for a charming tea cafe called "Tea2Go." The web page includes sections such as Home, About Us, Collection, and Contact, all carefully designed to evoke the essence of a welcoming tea haven.

## Features

- Home Page: Welcome visitors to Tea2Go with a warm and inviting hero banner that sets the tone for the entire web experience.

- About Us: Learn more about Tea2Go's story and my passion for tea as I take you on a journey through the world of tea.

- Collection: Explore an exquisite assortment of tea varieties, each thoughtfully selected to bring joy and comfort to our patrons. Don't forget to check out our "Tea of the Month" section, where you can explore our latest special blend available for a limited time.

- Contact: Get in touch with us easily through the "Contact" section. Whether you have inquiries, want to make reservations, or simply share your thoughts about our teas, we're always ready to listen.


## Technical Details

- **HTML Structure:** I've structured the web page using semantic HTML elements for better accessibility and search engine optimization.

- **CSS Flexbox:** The project heavily utilizes CSS Flexbox to create responsive and flexible layouts, ensuring seamless alignment of elements on the page.

- **Styling and Design:** Custom CSS styles have been implemented to create an appealing visual layout, drawing inspiration from various design sources.

- **Interactive Elements:** I've incorporated JavaScript to add interactivity to some elements, enhancing the user experience without compromising the primary focus on Flexbox.

- **Design Assets:** To enhance the visual aesthetics, I've utilized design assets from Freepik, Figma, Behance, and stunning photography from Unsplash.
