# üìù Overview

Tea2Go is a delightful virtual tea cafe that I've created as part of my web development journey at **[Codecademy](https://github.com/Codecademy)**. @codecademy The goal of this project is to showcase my skills in building a web page for a charming tea cafe called "Tea2Go." The web page includes sections such as Home, About Us, Collection, and Contact, all carefully designed to evoke the essence of a welcoming tea haven.

## üí° Features

- Collection: Showcase an exquisite assortment of tea varieties, including black tea, green tea, white tea, matcha, herbal tea, chai, oolong, rooibos, and more. The Collection page will also feature the "Tea of the Month," offering visitors the opportunity to explore the latest special blend available for a limited time.
- Contact: Offer multiple contact options for inquiries, feedback, and questions about the teas.
